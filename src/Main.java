/**

 *
 * This project is meant to be a testing ground for ideas in different projects.
 * I.E. if I want to implement a new tech in a project, but what to get some practice with using it first,
 * this project is what can be used to play around with ideas and see exactly how things work, without worrying
 * about messing the main project up.
 *
 * This project won't be as thoroughly commented, and most of the comments will mostly be made for myself as notes,
 * rather than as comments meant for other people.
